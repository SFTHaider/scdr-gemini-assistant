# scdr-gemini-assistant
SCDR Gemini Assistant is a natural-language interface for scdr-files-go, built to simplify NOAA SCDR satellite data access. Instead of memorizing command syntax, simply describe what you need in plain English, the assistant generates the correct command, validates it, and can execute it directly in your workflow.
